# Library Management System
This application was created by Kevin Flynn (C18502203) and Carl Herdman (C18703995).

This application was created in unison by communicating through online voice calls with the social media application 'Discord', and sharing files to each other using 'SharePoint'.

Two folders are contained in this repository: 'TheLibraryManagementSystemVersionsByKevinFlynn' and 'TheLibraryManagementSystemVersionsByCarlHerdman'.

The first folder contains the work completed by Kevin Flynn, and the second folder contains the work completed by Carl Herdman.

The final versions in each folder are the completed versions of the program ('KevinFlynnLibraryVersion10' and 'CarlHerdmanLibraryVersion5'), with everything fully functional and the requirements completely fulfilled.

The final versions in each folder are identical in functionality. The only difference between the two are how they handle data between the MS Access Database and the GUI (DataHandler.java).
