# Library Management System
This application was created by Kevin Flynn (C18502203) and Carl Herdman (C18703995).

This application was created in unison by communicating through online voice calls with the social media application 'Discord', and sharing files to each other using 'SharePoint'.

Two folders are contained in this repository: 'TheLibraryManagementSystemVersionsByKevinFlynn' and 'TheLibraryManagementSystemVersionsByCarlHerdman'.

The first folder contains the work completed by Kevin Flynn, and the second folder contains the work completed by Carl Herdman.

The final versions in each folder are the completed versions of the program ('KevinFlynnLibraryVersion10' and 'CarlHerdmanLibraryVersion5'), with everything fully functional and the requirements completely fulfilled in each.

The final versions in each folder are identical in functionality. The only difference between the two are how they handle data between the MS Access Database and the GUI (DataHandler.java file).

The versions are tracked to keep a record of the work completed by each student throughout the project.

This application was a collaborative effort with each person spending the same amount of time working on the project (50% of the work completed by each person).

Thank you for reading.
